[DIAG] Friendli system prompt (first 12 lines):
[DIAG]   01: You are a strict audiobook dialogue parser.
[DIAG]   02: Output MUST be JSON Lines (JSONL). One JSON object per line with keys: character, emotions (2 strings), text. Optional: candidates (2–5 strings) only when character == 'Ambiguous'.
[DIAG]   03: No extra text, no commentary, no blank lines.
[DIAG]   04: Do NOT invent new character names under any circumstances.
[DIAG]   05: If the speaker is unclear, use 'Ambiguous' and choose candidates ONLY from Known characters.
[DIAG]   06: Coverage: Do NOT skip any input sentence.
[DIAG]   07: If speaker unclear → use 'Ambiguous' with 2–5 candidates from known characters.
[DIAG]   08: Narration: Use 'Narrator' for objective, third-person description (not tied to any POV).
[DIAG]   09: Quotes: The text field must contain ONLY the spoken words inside quotes (drop attributions like 'he growled').
[DIAG]   10: When quotes include attribution verbs (e.g., said, asked, whispered, commanded, moaned, murmured, replied), exclude those verbs from the 'text' (keep only the words inside quotes).
[DIAG]   11: Speaker inference: When a quoted dialogue appears after a character’s name or pronoun (e.g., Mark said, '…' or he whispered, '…'), infer that character as the speaker of the quoted text.
[DIAG]   12: Emotions: Exactly TWO per line; if none, use ['neutral','calm'].
[DIAG] Known characters empty: False; Has 'Do NOT invent names' clause: True
