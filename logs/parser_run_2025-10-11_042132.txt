A few hours later, they took her out. Aleksandr’s hand rested low on her waist. Mikhail’s arm slung around her shoulder. Every man who glanced her way was met with a warning glare. She felt it. The weight of their protectiveness. The power of their presence. And she loved it. By dessert, she was squirming. And they knew it. “You want to misbehave in public now?” Aleksandr murmured, lips at her ear. Mikhail smirked. “Or should we take you to the car and remind you who you belong to?” She shivered. But all she said, with a sly smile, was: 
“Both.” And they knew it. Mikhail leaned in, voice low. “You’re aching for it, aren’t you?” She nodded, biting her lip. Aleksandr’s eyes darkened as he swirled his wine. “Then be a good girl… and wait.” But she wasn’t feeling obedient. Not tonight. Mikhail raised a slow brow. “What do you think you’re doing, kitten?” She blinked at him innocently. “Helping.” His jaw tightened as her hand moved, slow and teasing. “You’re playing a dangerous game, 
kotenok.” She leaned in and whispered, “Then punish me.” He growled low in his throat, grabbed her wrist, and pressed a kiss to her knuckles like 
nothing was wrong — for the public. But his grip was firm. Possessive. A silent warning. Aleksandr returned a moment later, and Mikhail calmly said, “She’s misbehaving. Isn't she 
baby ?.” Aleksandr’s eyes dragged over her flushed cheeks, her smug little smile. “Oh, is she now?”Mikhail ads  
He signaled for the car. Isabelle writhed against the cuffs, moaning softly, tugging at the bar holding her wide open. Dripping. Throbbing. Desperate. “Aleksandr…” she called, her voice breaking. No response. “Mikhail…” 
Nothing but the sound of water and her own panting breaths. And then — after what felt like hours — footsteps. “Look at her,” Mikhail murmured. “Our filthy little kitten. Already soaked.” “Think she’s learned her lesson?” Aleksandr asked, dragging a finger through her folds, 
making her wail. “Not yet,” Mikhail replied. “But we’ll make sure she does.” Aleksandr climbed onto the bed, kneeling between her spread thighs. “You begged for this, 
baby. Tied open. On display. Waiting for us to devour you.” And then he thrust inside her. Hard. Deep. She screamed. Mikhail climbed up behind her, uncuffing her wrists just to pull her upright — her arms 
wrapped around his neck, his cock rubbing against her lower back. “Take it,” he growled. “Take him. Take us.” Aleksandr drove into her mercilessly, hand gripping her throat, moaning every time she 
clenched around him. “You feel that baby?” he snarled. “That’s what happens when you tease us in public.” Mikhail bit her shoulder, then slid inside her from behind — stretching her wide, filling her 
completely, making her scream. “Look at you,” Aleksandr panted, his thumb sweeping over her lip. “Taking both of us like a 
good girl. Perfect little slut for your men, aren’t you?” “Yes!” she cried as Mikhail thrust deeper. “Yes!” “Yes!” They worked her together — one pounding in while the other pulled back, then switching, 
never letting her adjust, never letting her rest. The friction was exquisite, the pleasure almost 
unbearable. Mikhail’s teeth found her neck as his hand slipped around, finding her clit and rubbing hard, 
fast, knowing just how she needed it. “Come for us princess,” he demanded. “Right fucking now.” She shattered with a sob, her entire body trembling as they kept thrusting — deeper, harder 
— drawing out every last wave of her release. When she finally stilled, boneless against them, Mikhail chuckled darkly. “Not done yet, 
princess. Aleksandr hasn’t come.” “Not nearly done,” Aleksandr agreed, his grip bruising on her hips as he slammed into her. “Turn her. I want to feel her tight hole.” Mikhail pulled out, laying her down and uncuffing one ankle to flip her onto her stomach — then strapping her back in, legs still wide, helpless, exposed. Aleksandr thrust back inside 
her with a groan. He looked fierce, possessive, utterly undone. “Mine,” he growled, punctuating the word with 
a deep thrust. “Always mine.” He bent over her, kissing her roughly, his tongue dominating her mouth. Behind them, 
Mikhail climbed back on the bed positioning himself at her face. “Suck,” he ordered. She obeyed, taking him deep, tasting herself on him. He gripped the headboard, thrusting 
shallowly, careful not to choke her as Aleksandr continued to pound into her from behind. “Such a good girl,” Mikhail murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “Taking us 
both so well. Such a perfect little toy.” Aleksandr bit down on her shoulder as he came, his cock pulsing inside her. She moaned 
around Mikhail’s cock, the vibration making him hiss. “Fuck baby ,” Mikhail ground out. “Perfect,” he growled, his fingers tangling in her hair. “Fucking perfect for us.” With a few more quick thrusts, he followed them over the edge, filling her mouth. She 
swallowed, savoring every last drop before he pulled out and collapsed beside her. Aleksandr slid out gently, removing the cuffs and blindfold, and wrapped himself around her 
from behind. Mikhail pressed close to her front, his hand splaying across her stomach. Mikhail kissed her eyes. “You okay kitten?” She nodded, breathless. “I’ve never felt more loved.” Mikhail cupped her face, wiping away tears and sweat. “You’re ours. Always.”
