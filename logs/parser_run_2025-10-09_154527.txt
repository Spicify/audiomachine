And we’re going to enjoy every second.” But then they did the unthinkable. They left her there. Tied wide. Dripping. Blindfolded. And walked into the bathroom. She heard the water turn on. Their voices — soft, low, chuckling. The bastards were showering. Letting her squirm. She writhed against the cuffs, moaning softly, tugging at the bar holding her wide open. Dripping. Throbbing. Desperate. “Aleksandr…” she called, her voice breaking. No response. “Mikhail…” 
Nothing but the sound of water and her own panting breaths. And then — after what felt like hours — footsteps. “Look at her,” Mikhail murmured. “Our filthy little kitten. Already soaked.” “Think she’s learned her lesson?” Aleksandr asked, dragging a finger through her folds, 
making her wail. “Not yet,” Mikhail replied. “But we’ll make sure she does.” Aleksandr climbed onto the bed, kneeling between her spread thighs. “You begged for this, 
baby. Tied open. On display. Waiting for us to devour you.” And then he thrust inside her. Hard. Deep. She screamed. Mikhail climbed up behind her, uncuffing her wrists just to pull her upright — her arms 
wrapped around his neck, his cock rubbing against her lower back. “Take it,” he growled. “Take him. Take us.” Aleksandr drove into her mercilessly, hand gripping her throat, moaning every time she 
clenched around him. “You feel that baby?” he snarled. “That’s what happens when you tease us in public.” Mikhail bit her shoulder, then slid inside her from behind — stretching her wide, filling her 
completely, making her scream. “Look at you,” Aleksandr panted, his thumb sweeping over her lip. “Taking both of us like a 
good girl. Perfect little slut for your men, aren’t you?” “Yes!” she cried as Mikhail thrust deeper. “Yes!” “Yes!” They worked her together — one pounding in while the other pulled back, then switching, 
never letting her adjust, never letting her rest. The friction was exquisite, the pleasure almost 
unbearable. Mikhail’s teeth found her neck as his hand slipped around, finding her clit and rubbing hard, 
fast, knowing just how she needed it. “Come for us princess,” he demanded. “Right fucking now.” She shattered with a sob, her entire body trembling as they kept thrusting — deeper, harder 
— drawing out every last wave of her release. When she finally stilled, boneless against them, Mikhail chuckled darkly. “Not done yet, 
princess. Aleksandr hasn’t come.” “Not nearly done,” Aleksandr agreed, his grip bruising on her hips as he slammed into her. “Turn her. I want to feel her tight hole.” Mikhail pulled out, laying her down and uncuffing one ankle to flip her onto her stomach — then strapping her back in, legs still wide, helpless, exposed. Aleksandr thrust back inside 
her with a groan. He looked fierce, possessive, utterly undone. “Mine,” he growled, punctuating the word with 
a deep thrust. “Always mine.” He bent over her, kissing her roughly, his tongue dominating her mouth. Behind them, 
Mikhail climbed back on the bed positioning himself at her face. “Suck,” he ordered. She obeyed, taking him deep, tasting herself on him. He gripped the headboard, thrusting 
shallowly, careful not to choke her as Aleksandr continued to pound into her from behind. “Such a good girl,” Mikhail murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “Taking us 
both so well. Such a perfect little toy.” Aleksandr bit down on her shoulder as he came, his cock pulsing inside her. She moaned 
around Mikhail’s cock, the vibration making him hiss. “Fuck baby ,” Mikhail ground out. “Perfect,” he growled, his fingers tangling in her hair. “Fucking perfect for us.” With a few more quick thrusts, he followed them over the edge, filling her mouth. She 
swallowed, savoring every last drop before he pulled out and collapsed beside her. Aleksandr slid out gently, removing the cuffs and blindfold, and wrapped himself around her 
from behind. Mikhail pressed close to her front, his hand splaying across her stomach. Mikhail kissed her eyes. “You okay kitten?” She nodded, breathless. “I’ve never felt more loved.” Mikhail cupped her face, wiping away tears and sweat. “You’re ours. Always.”
