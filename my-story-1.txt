A few hours later, they took her out. 
The car was sleek, black, private. Aleksandr drove while Mikhail sat beside her in the back, 
one hand resting on her thigh. 
They brought her to a rooftop lounge — exclusive, glowing with lantern light, city skyline 
stretching behind them. She wore a sleek black dress Aleksandr had picked, high slit, low 
back, every inch of her confidence glowing beneath the necklace at her throat. 
They didn’t let her walk in alone. 
Aleksandr’s hand rested low on her waist. 
Mikhail’s arm slung around her shoulder. 
Every man who glanced her way was met with a warning glare. 
She felt it. The weight of their protectiveness. The power of their presence. 
And she loved it. 
Dinner was luxurious — fine wine, soft music, laughter over candlelight. But the heat never 
faded from their eyes. Aleksandr would kiss her neck between courses. Mikhail’s hand never 
left her thigh. 
By dessert, she was squirming. 
And they knew it. 
“You want to misbehave in public now?” Aleksandr murmured, lips at her ear. 
Mikhail smirked. “Or should we take you to the car and remind you who you belong to?” 
She shivered. 
But all she said, with a sly smile, was: 
“Both.” 
After dessert, she was squirming in her seat — legs pressed together, her skin hot beneath 
the cool silk of her dress. The wine had gone to her head, but not enough to dull the fire 
smoldering between her thighs. 
And they knew it. 
Mikhail leaned in, voice low. “You’re aching for it, aren’t you?” 
She nodded, biting her lip. 
Aleksandr’s eyes darkened as he swirled his wine. “Then be a good girl… and wait.” 
But she wasn’t feeling obedient. 
Not tonight. 
So when Aleksandr excused himself to take a call on the far end of the terrace, Isabelle 
reached under the table and let her hand slide over Mikhail’s thigh — up, up — until she 
cupped him over his trousers. 
Mikhail raised a slow brow. “What do you think you’re doing, kitten?” 
She blinked at him innocently. “Helping.” 
His jaw tightened as her hand moved, slow and teasing. “You’re playing a dangerous game, 
kotenok.” 
She leaned in and whispered, “Then punish me.” 
He growled low in his throat, grabbed her wrist, and pressed a kiss to her knuckles like 
nothing was wrong — for the public. But his grip was firm. Possessive. A silent warning. 
Aleksandr returned a moment later, and Mikhail calmly said, “She’s misbehaving. Isn't she 
baby ?.” 
Aleksandr’s eyes dragged over her flushed cheeks, her smug little smile. 
“Oh, is she now?” Mikhail adds.
He signaled for the car. 
The moment the doors shut behind them in the black SUV, tension snapped. 
Aleksandr pulled her straight onto his lap, facing him, the necklace bouncing against her 
chest. “That little stunt at dinner?” 
Mikhail slid into the seat beside them, leaning close. “Was cute. Reckless. And very brave 
kitten.” 
Her breath caught as Aleksandr gripped her thighs. “You wanted attention?” he growled. 
“I wanted you,” she breathed.
